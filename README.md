# PixelViewer
This is a simple executable app to run & dispaly 4x2 frame pixel animations 
to easily help me as I learn to improve my picel art ability.
I am primarily pulling pixel tutorials from ![Miniboss](https://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart"Miniboss")

* Divides PNG/JPG images and plays the resulting set of images as a pixel animation *

* Plays selected .WAV files over animation * 

* File selection of animation *

* (Custom compatible Image size) *

* (Custom frame ammounts ) *

* (Variable animation frame speeds ) *

## Skill developing

I plan on this project improving my skills in the following:

>Pixel art/animation primarily

>Quick, effective coding to solve problems.

>A post-COVD refresher on .md documentation.

>Windows forms graphics.

## Installing and Compiling:

**Requires a Winodws operating system! **

All files other than Anime.zip are for development purposes to look through my code.
To run the program, download Anime.zip, uncompress it and run PixelPlayer.exe 

The folder'Anime.zip' contains some sample .WAV files and compatible animation PNGs

To open an animation, press 'animation' in the toolbar, and select an appropriate 1600 * 800 px
image file.

To play audio over the animation, press the 'Sound' button ![Pic Of Audio Button](Audio.png "Audio") in the tool bar, and select a compatible .wav file.

This program will work with animations you create yourself, and some base files are included
